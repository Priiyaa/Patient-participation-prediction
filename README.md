# Patient-participation-prediction
A Machine learning model to predict patient's participation in a healthcare program. To run it copy the project , open it in VS CODE and in the VS code terminal type the command ```streamlit run app.py``` to see the model work. 
- The model uses Logistic Regression to predict the participation rate.
- It gives binary outputs i.e 0 or 1 indicating Low Probability and High probability respectively.
<br> *It is an ongoing project and I am trying to apply Neural Networks for the better performance.*
